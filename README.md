## Game Identity / Mantra: 

Mythological turn-based strategy game in VR, making you feel like a god controlling your forces on a war table

## Design Pillars:

- Tactical gameplay that requires you to juggle multiple systems and decisions
- Art style that evokes mythology/fantasy with a world that is literally tearing itself apart
- Tight enough to provide a fun, contained multiplayer experience, but in depth enough that it doesnâ€™t get stale

## To-do:

- Combat needs to happen in UI
- Custom spells, effects, actions
- UI design for action bar
- AI for other player
- Networking

# Bugs:

- Map parsing missing a food resource at tile 2,24
